Repo and documentation for NWO token


The New World Order (NWO) Token is an ERC-1155 multi-token standard based token to be deployed on the Goerli Test Network. This means that just like any other ERC-1155 token of its kind, it is a common interface for token management contracts that handle various token kinds. Any mix of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations may be used in a single deployed contract.

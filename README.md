# New-World-Order
Repo and documentation for NWO token


The New World Order (NWO) Token is an ERC-1155 multi-token standard based token to be deployed on the Goerli Test Network. This means that just like any other ERC-1155 token of its kind, it is a common interface for token management contracts that handle various token kinds. Any mix of fungible tokens, non-fungible tokens, or other configurations may be used in a single deployed contract.

This project includes multiple reknowned contributors like the Krypto-Kiddo , Sassycular and Nitrogen404 among a few big names. We encourage you to go 

Initially started as a university semester project for a blockchain course we barely attended. The project is aimed at providing both, liquified currency tokens and NFTs to its users.

> Tokens standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721 require a separate contract to be deployed for each token type or collection. This places a lot of redundant bytecode on the Ethereum blockchain and limits certain functionality by the nature of separating each token contract into its own permissioned address. With the rise of blockchain games and platforms like Enjin Coin, game developers may be creating thousands of token types, and a new type of token standard is needed to support them. However, ERC-1155 is not specific to games and many other applications can benefit from this flexibility.
